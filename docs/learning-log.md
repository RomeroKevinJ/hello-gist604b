# Learning Log - M1A3 GitHub Repository Management

**Student:** Kevin Romero Sanchez  
**Date:** 11/01/2025

## What I Learned
In this assignment, I learned:
- To create a public repository, add directories to repos, and save changes using commits.
- Issues help collaborators keep track of tasks and bugs in one place within the repository. Discussions and files can be organized and assigned to each team member.
- Documentation is important to provide context for the user. It can contain important information such as prerequisites, licenses, and common issues.

## Challenges and Solutions
The biggest challenge I faced when working in repositories is the markdown structure and editing within the repo itself. To avoid typos, I transfer my work into a word document for spellchecks and to keep track of markdown formatting I keep the instructor’s guide open while working.

## Connection to My GIS Career
GitHub skills will help develop my GIS career by providing me with context required to interact with developers in the open-source software space. Learning to create and manage my own repositories will help me understand other projects’ repositories so I can interact with the project collaborators.

## Open Source Workflow Understanding
Creating my own repository (`hello-gist604b`) mirrors the open source contribution process. In real projects, developers fork existing repositories, make improvements, and submit contributions - similar to how I created this repository and linked it to the assignment system.
